# Snake Game in Java üêçüéÆ

## Project Overview
A **Snake Game** developed in Java, where players control the snake to collect food while avoiding obstacles. The game features smooth gameplay, collision detection, and real-time updates.

## Features
- **Dynamic Snake Movement**: The snake grows as it eats food and moves according to user input.
- **Collision Detection**: Detects collisions with the game boundary and the snake‚Äôs body, which results in game over.
- **Score System**: Tracks the score based on the number of food items eaten.
- **Pause/Resume**: Allows the player to pause and resume the game.
- **Game Over Screen**: Displays a game over message along with the final score.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: For game logic and UI components.
- **Java Swing**: Used to create the graphical user interface (GUI) for rendering the game.
- **Java Timer**: To control the game's speed and update the screen.
